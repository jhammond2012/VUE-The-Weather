# VUE The Weather

This is a project built with Vue. It is meant to serve as a learning tool for me and a way to show off my Vue skills. The project is incomplete so check back in often.

## Known Issues or things I would like to improve
- [X] When editing the location (ZIP), the app should automatically update
- [ ] When initially setting the location, the app makes the get request before the zip is set so it requires a refresh for an accurate location
- [ ] table responsive issues
- [ ] general UI cleanup
